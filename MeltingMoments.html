    <p1>Melting Moments are a buttery crisp shortbread cookie that has a coating of powdered sugar. They are a popular
        Christmas cookie, maybe because they look like snowballs. While I'm not sure how this delicious butter cookie
        got its name, maybe it's because this cookie literally melts-in-your-mouth.Melting Moments store very well, up
        to two weeks, and they can be frozen. As far as the ingredients go, because there are not a lot of competing
        flavors in this cookie, try to use a good quality butter. Also, try to use 'pure' vanilla extract not the ones
        that are labeled 'imitation'. The batter contains both All Purpose Flour and Cornstarch, and it's the cornstarch
        (a fine white powder that comes from the inner grain (endosperm) of corn) that gives the cookies their wonderful
        melt-in-your-mouth crisp and crumbly texture. However, this also makes the cookies quite fragile so they're not
        a good cookie to ship.
