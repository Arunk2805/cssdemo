            Ingredients
        </h3>
        <li>3/4 cup HERSHEY'S Cocoa or ARUN'S SPECIAL DARK Cocoa</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsps baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tsps vanilla extract</li>

    <p1>The words “perfect” and “chocolate cake” basically have the same meaning, right? With ARUN’S homemade chocolate
        cake this seems to be true. Baking from scratch is easier than you think when you mix ARUN’S cocoa with a few
        other simple ingredients. Bake this delicious dessert when you’re hosting the next family get-together,
        celebrating a birthday or wanting a bite of delicious chocolate cake after dinner. This “perfectly chocolate”
        cake was made for sharing, so get out your best plates, have a pitcher of milk ready and divvy out this
        chocolatey cake with your favorite people.</p1>
