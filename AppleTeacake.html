    <p1>A mix of fresh apples and spices in a tender fluffy cake. This Apple Tea Cake is best served with a cup of tea
        or coffee in the afternoon.This Apple Tea Cake smells heavenly coming out of the oven which makes it very very
        difficult to wait for it to fully cool (but I recommend you do!) before slicing and enjoying a piece or two.It’s
        called a tea cake for a few reasons. It’s perfect in the afternoon with a cup of tea or coffee (but it can
        definitely be enjoyed for dessert or breakfast too) and it’s just a simple single layered cake. Not a huge fuss
        to make but wow does it taste incredible</p1>
