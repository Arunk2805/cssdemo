    <p1>Australia’s favourite biscuit! We love them for their buttery caramel flavour, how crunchy they are, that it’s a
        forgiving recipe and the history – this is a biscuit that Aussies make to commemorate ANZAC Day.</p1>

    <p2>“ANZAC” stands for Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. And ANZAC Day – 25 April 1915 – is Australia’s most
        important national occasion each year, marking the anniversary of the first major military action fought by
        Australian and New Zealand forces during the First World War during which we suffered heavy casualties.</p2>

    <p3>It is said that the wives of soldiers came up with the original Anzac Biscuits using ingredients such that the
        biscuits stayed fresh for the weeks it took to reach the soldiers overseas. I’m told that the original Anzac
        biscuits were as hard as a rock, so hard in fact that some soldiers would grind them up and use them as porridge
